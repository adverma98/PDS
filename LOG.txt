>Started Project
>Implemented code seen in part #1 of series
>Improved code by comparing different classifiers. Took help from https://github.com/Naresh1318/GenderClassifier/blob/master/Run_Code.py
>Classifiers: (hazy)
	>Decision Tree:
		# Makes a Tree using labels from test data
		# Once trained, it compares the tree data with the input and decides the prediction

	>SVM:
		# Support Vector Machine
		# Redefines data so that a clear hyperplane can be chosen
	
	>Perceptron:
		# Uses input characteristics and weights to compute a score for said input
		# Compares said score to a threshold
		# Assigns a corr. Y label output using the result obtained from the above comparison

>Accuracy score is used to choose the most accurate classifiers for our data
